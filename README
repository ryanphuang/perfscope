This is the source tree for PerfScope, a neat tool for analyzing given
patch's performance impact to existing source repository. 

PerfScope is a research project from the [Opera Research Group](http://opera.ucs.edu) 
in University of California, San Diego. It consists of several parts to operate:
- Parser: parse the patch file for information like what's the file(s) that's modified,
    which location does it lie, etc.
- Resolver: resolve the dependencies among the modifications inside a patch found by the parser.
- Analyzer: analyze the change(s)' performance impact
- TestDB: a particular use case of PerfScope: prioritize performance testing based on the impact
    analysis result. This module will also keep track of each performance testing execution
    information to help do test selection.
