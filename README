This is the source tree for PerfScope, a neat tool for analyzing given
patch's performance impact to existing source repository. 

PerfScope is a research project from the [Opera Research Group](http://opera.ucsd.edu) 
in University of California, San Diego. It consists of several parts to operate:
- Parser: parses the patch file for information like what's the file(s) that's modified,
    which location does it lie, etc.
- Mapper: maps the change location in source file to the corresponding programming constructs.
- Filter: prunes out insignificant changes such as stylish changes or renaming. The 
    main tool is tools/PerfDiff which takes before-revision and after-revision programs 
    and checks if the changes are trivial.
- Profile Database: contains a list of frequent or expensive functions. White-list functions
    can also be added to the profile.
- Analyzer: performs Performance Risk Analysis (PRA) on given commit.
- TestDB: tracks performance test cases  execution information to further recommend 
    which test case may be useful to uncover the performance regression issues.
