Intro
=====
This is the parser part of PerfScope. It's in charge of parsing the raw patch file and output another unified
format to feed into mapper. Note that, although parser's main job is translating the diff, it should also
do validation and some pre-filtering(skip non-source modifications).


Output Format
============
The current output format is:
    <output> ::= "****"<FILENAME>"\n"<body>

    <body> ::= <unit> | <unit>"\n"<body> 
    
    <unit> ::= <file_section>"\n"<hunk_sections>

    <file_section> ::= "===="<FILENAME>

    <hunk_sections> ::= <hunk_section> | <hunk_section>"\n"<hunk_sections>

    <hunk_section> ::= "####"<LINE>"\n"<control_seq>
    
    <control_seq> ::= "-"<control_seq> | "+"<control_seq> | "~"<control_seq> | ""

Example:
    ****1024.diff
    ====sql/sql_select.cc
    ####123
    ~~~-++++~~~---
    ####477
    ~--~~++~~---
