Like many open source projects, PerfScope is not built 
entirely from scratch but borrows the building blocks from
other projects of good quality.

This directory holds the external source code we used from
1. GNU patch program
2. DSA (data structure analysis) 
3. Program Dependence Graph

2. and 3. are based on LLVM poolalloc project https://llvm.org/viewvc/llvm-project/poolalloc
with slight modifications. They were used in early stage of PerfScope to quickly try 
slicing. Now we reimplement the dependence graph and these two are therefore deprecated.
