    <h1>What is PerfScope?</h1>
    <p>
        PerfScope is a neat tool to evaluate a patch's performance impact to the 
        software system. It can work seamlessly with existing performance testing harness
        to guide the prioritization of testing. Also, it can provide hint in respect of
        which change set is more risky when doing triaging of performance regression issues.
