A helper tool to generate a list of expensive function or
frequent functions using static analysis instead of dynamic
profiling.

It estimates a functions' expensiveness based on a static 
cost model. Frequency of a function is estimated based on
its number of call sites.

Example of usage:

  Debug+Asserts/bin/staticprofiler -o mysql.profile -m 100 -n 100 mysqld.bc
